        <h3>WHY WATCH RUSSIAN GRAND BALLET ?</h3>
        <h3>ONCE UPON A TIME</h3>
        <P>Russian Grand Ballet was founded by and incorporated graduates from the Great Russian choreographic 
            schools of Moscow, St. Petersburg and Kiev. It has established a reputation for talent and versatility 
            by touring the world with both full-length traditional ballets and shorter ‘divertissements.’ Its 
            Ballet Master, Honored Artist of Russia, Vladimir Troshchenko, is highly dedicated to the timeless 
            tradition of classical Russian Ballet. The principal dancers of the company came from the upper 
            ranks of the great ballet companies and academies. Today, the Russian Grand Ballet Theatre is its own 
            institution, with over 50 brilliant dancers. Following successful US debut performances at over 25 
            beautiful theaters all across the country during 2015 Northern American Tour, the troupe is coming 
            back with the world’s favorite fairy tale "The Sleeping Beauty" and the most famous ballet "The Swan Lake"!</P>
        <H3>WHAT'S THE STORY?</H3>
        <P>Until 1689, ballet in Russia was nonexistent (ballet has its origins in the courts of the Italian 
            Renaissance in the 15th and 16th centuries.)[citation needed] The Tsarist control and isolationism 
            in Russia allowed for little influence from the West. It wasn't until the rise of Peter the Great that
             Russian society opened up to the West. St. Petersburg was erected to embrace the West and compete 
             against Moscow's isolationism. Peter the Great created a new Russia which rivaled the society of the 
             West with magnificent courts and palaces. His vision was to challenge the west. Classical ballet 
             entered the realm of Russia not as entertainment, but as a "standard of physical comportment to be 
             emulated and internalized – an idealized way of behaving."[1] The aim was not to entertain the masses 
             of Russians, but to cultivate new Russian people.</P>
