                <h3>LION KING</h3>
                <P>The Lion King tells the story of Simba (Swahili for lion), a lion cub who is to succeed his father, 
                    Mufasa, as King of the Pride Lands; however, after his paternal uncle Scar kills Mufasa to seize 
                    the throne, Simba is tricked into believing he was responsible for his father's death and flees 
                    into exile. After growing up in the company of the carefree outcasts Timon and Pumbaa, Simba receives 
                    valuable perspective from his childhood friend, Nala, and his shaman, Rafiki, before returning to 
                    challenge Scar to end his tyranny and take his place in the Circle of Life as the rightful king.</P>

                <H3>FIDDLER ON THE ROOF</H3>
                <P>Fiddler on the Roof is a musical with music by Jerry Bock, lyrics by Sheldon Harnick, 
                    and book by Joseph Stein, set in the Pale of Settlement of Imperial Russia in or around 1905. 
                    It is based on Tevye and his Daughters (or Tevye the Dairyman) and other tales by Sholem Aleichem. 
                    The story centers on Tevye, a milkman in the village of Anatevka, who attempts to maintain his 
                    Jewish religious and cultural traditions as outside influences encroach upon his family's lives.
                     He must cope with the strong-willed actions of his three older daughters who wish to marry for love; 
                     their choices of husbands are successively less palatable for Tevye. An edict of the tsar eventually 
                     evicts the Jews from their village.</P>
