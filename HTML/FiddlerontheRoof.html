        <h3>WHY FIDDLER ON THE ROOF?</h3>
        <h3></h3>
        <P>Fiddler on the Roof is a musical with music by Jerry Bock, lyrics by Sheldon Harnick, 
            and book by Joseph Stein, set in the Pale of Settlement of Imperial Russia in or around 1905. 
            It is based on Tevye and his Daughters (or Tevye the Dairyman) and other tales by Sholem Aleichem. 
            The story centers on Tevye, a milkman in the village of Anatevka, who attempts to maintain his 
            Jewish religious and cultural traditions as outside influences encroach upon his family's lives.
             He must cope with the strong-willed actions of his three older daughters who wish to marry for love; 
             their choices of husbands are successively less palatable for Tevye. An edict of the tsar eventually 
             evicts the Jews from their village.</P>

        <P>The original Broadway production of the show, which opened in 1964, had the first musical theatre 
            run in history to surpass 3,000 performances. Fiddler held the record for the longest-running 
            Broadway musical for almost 10 years until Grease surpassed its run. The production was 
            extraordinarily profitable and highly acclaimed. It won nine Tony Awards, including best musical, 
            score, book, direction and choreography. It spawned five Broadway revivals and a highly successful 
            1971 film adaptation and has enjoyed enduring international popularity. It has also been a popular 
            choice for school and community productions</P>
