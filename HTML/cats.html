        <h3>WHY WATCH CATS?</h3>
        <h3>ONCE UPON A TIME</h3>
        <P>"Cats" is a whimsical and visually stunning musical that offers a unique and imaginative take 
            on the world of cats. The film has been both praised and criticized for its use of computer-
            generated effects to create the feline characters, and for its overall plot and pacing. 
            However, fans of the musical and lovers of musical theater in general may still find the film 
            to be an enjoyable and entertaining experience.</P>
        <H3>WHAT'S THE STORY?</H3>
        <P>The movie "Cats" is based on the popular stage musical of the same name by Andrew Lloyd Webber, 
            which is in turn based on a collection of poems by T.S. Eliot. The story revolves around a 
            group of cats known as the Jellicles, who gather together for their annual Jellicle Ball, 
            where they must make the case for why they deserve to be chosen to ascend to the Heaviside 
            Layer and be reincarnated into a new life.</P>
