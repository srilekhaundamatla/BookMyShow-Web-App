        <H3>WHAT'S THE STORY?</H3>
        <P>Sunday in the Park with George is a musical with music and lyrics by Stephen Sondheim and book by 
            James Lapine. It was inspired by the French pointillist painter Georges Seurat's painting A Sunday
            Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte. The plot revolves around George, a fictionalized version 
            of Seurat, who immerses himself deeply in painting his masterpiece, and his great-grandson (also 
            named George), a conflicted and cynical contemporary artist. The Broadway production opened in 1984.</P>
