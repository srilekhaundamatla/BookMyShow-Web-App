        <H3>WHAT'S THE STORY?</H3>
        <P>Monster Jam is a live motorsport event that features massive trucks with oversized wheels, known as 
            Monster Trucks, performing stunts and feats of strength in a variety of competitions.The trucks, 
            which can weigh up to 12,000 pounds and stand up to 12 feet tall, are customized with powerful 
            engines and suspension systems that allow them to jump, flip, and perform other high-flying tricks. 
            The drivers, who are some of the most skilled and daring in the world, compete in a number of 
            different events, including racing, freestyle, and donut competitions.In racing events, the trucks 
            compete head-to-head on a track filled with obstacles, jumps, and tight turns. The first truck to 
            cross the finish line without incurring a penalty wins. In freestyle events, the trucks perform a 
            series of high-flying stunts and tricks, earning points based on their difficulty and execution.
            Monster Jam events also often include specialty competitions, such as the two-wheel skills 
            competition, where drivers attempt to drive their trucks on two wheels for as long as possible, 
            or the donut competition, where they try to spin their trucks in tight circles.</P>
