        <H3>WHAT'S THE STORY?</H3>
        <P>The movie "Hairspray" ells the story of Tracy Turnblad, a teenage girl who dreams of dancing on 
            "The Corny Collins Show," a popular local TV dance program. Despite facing discrimination and 
            ridicule for her size and unconventional appearance, Tracy is determined to achieve her dream, 
            and she begins to attend auditions for the show. Along the way, she makes new friends, including 
            a group of African American students who are fighting for integration and equal rights. As 
            Tracy's star rises on the show, she becomes increasingly involved in the civil rights movement 
            and begins to use her newfound platform to advocate for change. However, she faces opposition 
            from the show's producer, Velma Von Tussle, and her scheming daughter, Amber, who are determined 
            to maintain the status quo and keep the show segregated.</P>
