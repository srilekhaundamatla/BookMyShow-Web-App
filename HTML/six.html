        <h3>WHY WATCH SIX ?</h3>
        <h3>ONCE UPON A TIME</h3>
        <P>Six by Sondheim is an HBO television documentary which pays tribute to Broadway composer and 
            lyricist Stephen Sondheim. The film was directed and co-produced by James Lapine, based on an 
            idea by Frank Rich and "centers on the backstory of six great Sondheim songs".</P>
        <H3>WHAT'S THE STORY?</H3>
        <P>In the documentary, Sondheim himself performs along with Audra McDonald, Jeremy Jordan, 
            Darren Criss, America Ferrera, Jackie Hoffman and Laura Osnes. The documentary contains 
            archival footage as well as footage shot for a revue of Sondheim's music that played on 
            Broadway in 2010 titled Sondheim on Sondheim.The documentary consists of both original 
            short films of several of the songs plus existing material. For example, Lapine directed 
            the part on "Opening Doors" which features Criss, Jordan, Ferrera, and Osnes; Todd Haynes 
            directed the film on "I'm Still Here" which has Jarvis Cocker; and Autumn De Wilde directed 
            McDonald and Will Swenson in "Send in the Clowns." The film was edited by Miky Wolf who 
            gave an interview to The Red Room Podcast on episode 68. This interview was then published 
            in the Summer 2014 The Sondheim Review.</P>
