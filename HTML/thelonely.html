        <h3>WHY WATCH THE LONELY FEW ?</h3>
        <h3>ONCE UPON A TIME</h3>
        <P>Lila (Lauren Patten, Tony Award winner for Jagged Little Pill) is getting by in her Kentucky 
            hometown—scanning groceries at the Save-A-Lot, caring for her erratic brother, and living 
            for Friday nights, when she plays a gig with her band The Lonely Few. And that's enough. 
            Or she thought it was, until Amy (Ciara Renée, Frozen, Waitress), an established musician 
            \ragged from the road, passes through and offers her a shot at something much, much bigger. 
            But is Lila ready for the life she never dared to imagine? A world premiere musical by Zoe 
            Sarnak and Rachel Bonds, The Lonely Few is a love story between two women searching for a 
            sense of home.</P>
